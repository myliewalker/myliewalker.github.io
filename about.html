        <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
            I am a sophomore at Duke University. Currently, I am planning to study computer science, mathematics, and markets & management.
            My interest in tech began this fall, when I began studying CS. Over the course of this year I have built back-end knowledge
            by taking courses on data structure and algorithms, and computer architecutre. In conjunction with these classes, I have 
            completed several projects in Java and C, and have learned about ways to optimize computer performance. I also taught myself
            web development to complement my back-end skills.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            In addition to my technical knowledge, I also have research and client-based experience. I have previously interned in biology
            labs and at nonprofit organizations including the Innocence Project and the Uruguayan Consulate. These internships have provided
            me with experience designing consumer-based products, and have shown me the importance of strong client relations. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            I also have experience designing consumer-based products. At Duke, I am a member of a business society. As part of a 6-week 
            long training process, I worked in a team of four to design a refrigerator for the disabled. We studied the refrigerator 
            market and demand for our product extensively, then adapted our initial version based on feedback. Ultimately, we won the 
            challenge. While this product fills a specific niche, the work has strengthened my understanding of consumers, and the 
            ways in which products are designed to fill a specific group's needs.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            In my free time, I enjoy watching sports and listening to music. Through my love of football and experience playing lacrosse,
            I also became interested in CTE, a neurodegenerative disease that results from repeated blows to the head. After learning about
            this disease, I have become increasingly interested in medical technology, and specifically the ways in which doctors can
            use it in order to reduce an athlete's risk of long-term ramifications from their time as a player.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            I am eager to gain more experience in tech and learn about its numerous applications in healthcare, finance, and entertainment.
