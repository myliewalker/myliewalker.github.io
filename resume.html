            <h2>Technical Experience</h2>
            <h3>Book Finder</h3>
            <p>I built a web app that stores and suggests books from a book list. Users can recommend books they have enjoyed, 
                and to also enter characteristics of a book that they would like to read. It matches their preferences
                with books stored in a realtime database and displays the top results.</p>          
            
            <h3>Autocomplete Project</h3>
            <p>I developed an algorithm that efficiently sorts search terms that begin with a given query. It functions similarly
                to the suggested terms list generated in Google searches. The algorithms sorts terms based first on their
                likelihood to occur, and then alphabetically.

            <h2>Work Experience</h2>
            <h3>Brooklyn Defender Services</h3>
            <p>I used a program that compares lists of current and former inmates to update the firm’s client directory, as well 
                as it's catalogue of clients eligible for parole. I imaged over 20 new computers and assisted in updating computer
                systems in order to achieve optimal performance.
            </p>

            <h3>Gruss Lipper Biophotonics Lab</h3>
            <p>I developed and tested a near-infrared biosensor. This biosensor is a chemical tool that detects the activity of 
                RhoA, a protein whose functionality is important for many different types of cancer. Unlike previous biosensors, 
                this version allows for the visualization of tumors and cells in living organisms. Ultimately, I developed two versions: 
                one with better efficiency, and another with higher protein expression.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Casanova Lab</h3>
            <p>I genetically analyzed DNA samples in order to experimentally determine whether individuals are genetically 
                susceptible to acquire tuberculosis. In order to do this, I amplified DNA and then a specific part of the sequence through
                software to analyze it. After reading this sequence, I identified the genotype of each individual and determined whether
                they were genetically susceptible to TB.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Uruguayan Consulate</h3>
            <p>I helped with the consulate’s outreach by researching Uruguayan events in New York and identifying organizations
                that might be interested in collaborating with the consulate to host events. I also located universities 
                with a Latin American Studies program that recent immigrants might be interested in studying. Overall, I increased 
                the consulate’s outreach program by 20%.

            <h2>Extracurricular Activities</h2>
            <h3>Scale and Coin Business Society</h3>
            <p>I was selected as 1 of 17 members out of 100+ applicants to participate in a 6-week long training process. During
                this period I attended weekly teach-ins and meeting, pitched stocks and startups, designed a refrigerator for the
                blind, and worked a consulting case. 
            </p>
            <h3>DTech Associate</h3>
            <p>I am a member of Duke's primary program to support women interested in tech. As part of this opportunity, I participate
                in workshops related to software engineering, front-end development, and product design.
            </p>
            <h3>Hunter Action Against Hunger</h3>
            <p>I worked with other board members to organize school-wide fundraisers that each raised over $500. The entire organization
                also went on bi-annual "runs" around NYC to distribute food, clothing, and toiletries to the homeless.

            <h2>Skills</h2>
            <h3>Foreign Languages</h3>
            <p>As a half-Peruvian I learned to speak Spanish with my mom and grandparents, as well as in school. I am currently
                fluent, and am hoping to study abroad in Spain in order to my abilities further.
            </p>
            <h3>Coding Languages</h3>
            <ul class="list-group row">
                <li class="list-group-item col-xs-6">C</li>
                <li class="list-group-item col-xs-6">CSS</li>
                <li class="list-group-item col-xs-6">Java</li>
                <li class="list-group-item col-xs-6">HTML</li>
                <li class="list-group-item col-xs-6">MIPS</li>
                <li class="list-group-item col-xs-6">JavaScript</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>General Skills</h3>
            <p>I have experience a strong understanding of the efficiency tradeoffs of different algorithms and have experience
                developing commonly used ones, including sorting and searching ones. Through my CS classes I have also learned
                about the microarchitectural design concepts implemented in computers, and gained an understanding of how the 
                interactions with memory impact program performance. To complement my understanding of back-end operations, I
                taught myself the fundamentals of web development.
                <br>
                <br>
                Outside my classes, I have gained experience using PowerPoint through my involvement in Scale & Coin, a business society
                at Duke.. As part of a six-week training process to join the organization, I have given stock pitches, presented my team's
                design for a refrigerator for the disabled, and worked on a mock consulting case. These presentations have given me 
                experience developing both formal and informal decks, shown me how to balance content and visual components, and helped 
                me become a strong, compelling public speaker.
